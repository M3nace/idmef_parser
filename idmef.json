Only one analyzer may be encoded for each alert or heartbeat, and that MUST be the analyzer at which the alert or heartbeat originated.  Although the IDMEF data model does not prevent the use of hierarchical intrusion detection systems (where alerts get relayed up the tree), it does not provide any way to record the identity of the \"relay\" analyzers along the path from the originating analyzer to the manager that ultimately receives the alert.
