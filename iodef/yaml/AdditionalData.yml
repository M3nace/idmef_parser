name: AdditionalData
description: 'The AdditionalData class serves as an extension mechanism for information
  not otherwise represented in the data model.  For relatively simple information,
  atomic data types (e.g., integers, strings) are provided with a mechanism to annotate
  their meaning. The class can also be used to extend the data model (and the associated
  Schema) to support proprietary extensions by encapsulating entire XML documents
  conforming to another Schema (e.g., IDMEF).  A detailed discussion for extending
  the data model and the schema can be found in Section 5. '
