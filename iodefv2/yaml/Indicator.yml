description: 'The Indicator class describes an indicator.  An indicator consists of
  observable features and phenomenon that aid in the forensic or proactive detection
  of malicious activity and associated metadata. An indicator can be described outright
  by referencing or composing previously defined indicators or by referencing observables
  described in the incident report found in this document. '
