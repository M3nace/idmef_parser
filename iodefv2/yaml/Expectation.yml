  the actions the sender is requesting. '
aggregates:
  Description:
    name: Description
    multiplicity: 0..*
    type: ML_STRING
    description: A free-form text description of the desired action(s).
  DefinedCOA:
    name: DefinedCOA
    multiplicity: 0..*
    type: STRING
    description: A unique identifier meaningful to the sender and recipient of this
      document that references a course of action.  This class MUST be present if
      the action attribute is set to "defined-coa".
  StartTime:
    name: StartTime
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: DATETIME
    description: The time at which the sender would like the action performed.  A
      timestamp that is earlier than the ReportTime specified in the Incident class
      denotes that the sender would like the action performed as soon as possible.  The
      absence of this element indicates no expectations of when the recipient would
      like the action performed.
  EndTime:
    name: EndTime
    multiplicity: 0..1
    type: DATETIME
    description: The time by which the sender expects the recipient to complete the
      action.  If the recipient cannot complete the action before EndTime, the recipient
      MUST NOT carry out the action.  Because of transit delays and clock drift, the
      sender MUST be prepared for the recipient to have carried out the action, even
      if it completes past EndTime.
