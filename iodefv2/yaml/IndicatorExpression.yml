name: IndicatorExpression
description: 'The IndicatorExpression describes an expression composed of observed
  phenomenon, features, or indicators.  Elements of the expression can be described
  directly, reference relevant data from other parts of a given IODEF document, or
  reference previously defined indicators. '
aggregates:
